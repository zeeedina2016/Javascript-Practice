# Javascript-Practice
All my javascript practice!
- First Program: A program that allows a user to insert x/y intercepts and finds the slope of a line for them.( this is a very simple program!)
-Second Program: This wa smy easiest one so far, in terms of the amount of lines I guess. I just had to create a prgram that is given integer input by user and all it had to do was return an integer bewteen the two input given by the user
